### A form for controlling band members. Created with Vue JS 3 technology.

## Resume:

It is a web application developed by me based on a VUE JS 3 course, which serves as band member control, allowing you to insert one or more members into the band, exercising user input methods and Two-way Data Binding.
Study of concepts in relation to objects and arrays.

## functionalities:

+ Add one or more members with user input

## Technologies Used:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Vue Js 3.0</td>
    <td>HTML</td>
    <td>CSS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>*The JavaScript framework used to build the application's user interface and dynamic functionalities.</td>
    <td>*The markup language that structures the page content.</td>
    <td>*The styling language that defines the layout and visual presentation of the application.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## How to run the application

In a practical and quick way you can install the "Live Server" extension, which starts a local development server with live reload feature for static and dynamic pages:
1) Open the project and click "Go Live" in the Visual Studio Code status bar to turn the server on/off.
    *If Go Live is not appearing, open the HTML file and right-click anywhere in the file, click Open with Live Server.
